# Nougat Inference to Read Scientific PDFs

This project uses the `Nougat` model for reading scientific PDFs, leveraging Hugging Face transformers and PyTorch for model inference.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-link>
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

This project includes a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates how to perform inference on scientific PDFs using the Nougat model.

1. Open the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Nougat_Inference_to_read_scientific_PDFs.ipynb
   ```
2. Run the notebook to see how the model processes the input PDF.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Hugging Face `transformers` and `huggingface_hub`
- PyTorch
- Pillow
- PyMuPDF
